Performance Optimizations Applied:
==================================

✅ 1. Progressive Rendering
   - Removed blocking loaders
   - Added skeleton UI for loading states
   - Components render as data becomes available

✅ 2. Code Splitting with Lazy Loading
   - CompensationAnalysis lazy loaded
   - RadarAnalytics lazy loaded
   - PredictiveCompChart lazy loaded
   - AiCareerInsights lazy loaded
   - NextSteps lazy loaded
   - CareerDashboard lazy loaded

✅ 3. React.memo Applied
   - UserProfileCard memoized
   - CompensationAnalysis memoized
   - RadarAnalytics memoized

✅ 4. LazyMotion with framer-motion
   - Using domAnimation features
   - Components use optimized 'm' instead of 'motion'
   - Reduced bundle size for animations

Expected Performance Improvements:
- TBT (Total Blocking Time): Should be reduced from 590ms to <200ms
- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): Should be reduced from 3.7s to <2.5s
- Bundle Size: Reduced through code splitting
- Initial Load: Faster with progressive rendering

To test performance:
1. Make sure dev server is running on port 3002
2. Run: npx lighthouse http://localhost:3002/users/test-user --view
3. Or use Chrome DevTools Lighthouse tab

Note: For best results, test in production mode:
  yarn build && yarn start
